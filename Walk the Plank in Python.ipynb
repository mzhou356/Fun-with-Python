    "  * At the start of the game, show the number of letters in the word using symbol \"-\"\n",
    "  * Chances is (26-number of unique letters in the word)/2, not given to the user\n",
    "  * Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.\n",
    "  * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess about whether their guess appears in the computer's word by displaying to the user the partially guessed word.  \n",
    "  * A user loses a chance when he/she guesses not a letter, repeats a letter, or guesses incorectly.\n",
    "  * A user doesn't lose a chance if he/she guesses correctly.\n",
    "  * The game ends when the user guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses. \n",
    "  * If the player runs out of guesses, reveal the answer to the user. "
